# Webserv

Write your own HTTP server in C++. Resilience is key. Your server must remain operational at all times.

The goal is to understand the intricacies of the HTTP protocol. It's one of the most widely used protocols on the internet. Read the RFCs defining the HTTP protocol, and compare your program’s behaviour with NGINX’s.
